# Changelog

## Unreleased

### New
- XY charts: the y-axis title is drawn (above the ticks in vertical charts, under the value axis in horizontal ones), and horizontal charts now render line series instead of falling back to vertical

### Behavior changes
- Sequence: block frames (alt, loop, par, ...) span only the participants they involve, matching Mermaid, instead of every lifeline
- Class and ER diagrams: several relationships leaving or entering the same box are spread further apart, and lines that jog sideways between layers each get their own row, so the gap between layers grows with the number of crossings

### Fixes
- Sequence scope frames now enclose their messages, notes, branches, and nested frames. Deep nesting no longer crosses message arrows, and long scope titles remain inside their borders.
- Sequence: else/and section labels keep their spaces instead of being drawn with dashes
- Flowchart: open links with a label (`A ---|text| B`) no longer get an arrowhead
- Flowchart: `A -- text --> B` is a normal-length link again; the leading dashes were being counted as extra length, which stretched the layout
- Flowchart: sibling subgraphs kept the same order between runs only by luck (hash order); layout is now deterministic
- State diagrams: transitions to or from a composite state attach to its border instead of drawing a duplicate plain state next to it
- Class and ER diagrams: relationship labels and cardinalities are drawn after all lines, so a later line no longer erases them; side-by-side boxes are joined with a straight line instead of a kinked one; two relationships between the same pair of classes get separate rows instead of overwriting each other; cardinalities no longer land on a box border

## 0.8.0 (2026-07-29)

### New
- Flowchart: edges can link subgraphs directly (`A --> B` where A and B are subgraphs), matching Mermaid semantics. All mixed forms work too: subgraph to node, node to subgraph, and links across subgraphs. Edges attach to the subgraph border with a proper tee and arrowhead instead of grabbing an inner node (#6)

### Fixes
- Flowchart layout: edges with subgraph endpoints now constrain layer assignment, so chains like `A --> C --> B` stack vertically instead of piling into overlapping rows
- Flowchart layout: the space between subgraph boxes is sized by counting the actual borders in each gap; sibling boxes no longer touch when a standalone node shares a row, and the workaround of passing a large `--gap` is no longer needed
- Flowchart routing: edges no longer cut through unrelated subgraph boxes when a route around them exists

## 0.7.1 (2026-06-11)

### Fixes
- Gantt: the widest task label is no longer truncated (the margin was sized 2 columns short of its own content)
- Kanban: the widest card is no longer truncated (same off-by-two in column sizing); `id[Title]` cards with trailing `@metadata` now unwrap correctly
- CJK/emoji labels no longer overflow boxes or destroy borders in class, ER, gantt, kanban, packet, and treemap renderers; new shared `truncate_to_width()` helper never splits a wide character
- Sequence: self-messages reserve the rows they draw, so the next message's label no longer overwrites the loop's return arrow; CJK message labels are no longer clipped
- Block diagrams: blocks nested two or more groups deep are rendered instead of silently dropped

## 0.7.0 (2026-06-11)

### Behavior changes
- `render()` and `render_rich()` now raise exceptions on failure instead of returning an error string; the CLI reports errors on stderr and exits with code 1 (previously it exited 0 with the error in stdout or the `-o` file)
- `render_rich()` accepts a `gap` parameter

### Fixes
- `--theme` no longer silently ignores `-o` (ANSI output is written to the file), `--show-ids`, `--gap`, and `--width`/auto-fit
- Missing `rich` with `--theme` now prints the install hint instead of a raw ImportError
- Flowchart: semicolons inside quoted labels (`A["a;b"]`) no longer split the statement
- Sequence: inline `-` activation marker deactivates the sender, not the receiver, matching Mermaid semantics
- Gantt: the `dateFormat` directive is honored (e.g. `DD-MM-YYYY`); non-ISO dates no longer silently drop task bars
- Kanban: `id[Title]` syntax is supported for columns and cards
- Quadrant/XY chart: malformed numbers like `0.1.2` no longer crash the parser
- State diagram: notes and redeclarations no longer reset `<<choice>>`/`<<fork>>`/`<<join>>` shapes
- Canvas: wide (CJK) characters at out-of-bounds positions no longer crash or corrupt rows
- Layout: orthogonal subgraphs containing a cycle no longer drop or duplicate nodes
- File I/O uses explicit UTF-8 encoding
- `--version` fallback no longer reports a stale version

## 0.6.1 (2026-03-30)

### Fixes

## 0.6.0 (2026-03-30)

### New diagram types
- **Gantt chart** (`gantt`): horizontal bar chart with sections, task tags (done/active/crit/milestone), `after` dependencies, duration syntax, auto-chaining, vertical markers, today marker
- **Architecture diagram** (`architecture-beta`): service/group/junction layout with L/R/T/B direction hints for 2D grid positioning, icon prefixes, invisible junction elimination
- 18 diagram types now supported

## 0.5.0 (2026-03-29)

### New diagram types
- **XY Chart** (`xychart-beta` / `xychart`): bar charts, line charts, bar+line combos, horizontal orientation, rounded/sharp line corners, JSON ingest
- **User Journey** (`journey`): horizontal task timeline with sections, satisfaction emoji scores, multi-actor symbols (●◆■▲), rounded/sharp/ASCII corners
- **Packet diagram** (`packet` / `packet-beta`): bit-aligned network packet layouts with separated boxes per row, boundary numbers, auto-increment (`+N`) syntax, truncated label legend with bit ranges
- 16 diagram types now supported

### Improvements
- CJK/wide character display width fix (merged from community PR)
- Applied `display_width()` to all new renderers
- XY chart: even y-axis proportions, rounded line corners

## 0.4.0 (2026-03-26)

### New diagram types
- **Timeline** (`timeline` syntax): vertical event list with sections and details
- **Kanban** (`kanban` syntax): column-based task boards with cards
- **Quadrant chart** (`quadrantChart` syntax): 2x2 grid with plotted data points
- 13 diagram types now supported

### New themes
- **Solid-background themes**: `gruvbox`, `monokai`, `dracula`, `nord`, `solarized` with filled region backgrounds
- Per-section coloring: kanban columns, quadrant regions, and timeline sections get distinct colors
- Depth shading: kanban cards use a lighter shade of the column color
- `--themes` flag to list all available themes

### New features
- **JSON ingest** (`--json TYPE`): pipe structured data and render as treemap, pie, mindmap, or flowchart
- **`--demo [TYPE]`**: render sample diagrams for any diagram type
- **`padding_x` and `gap`** now supported by sequence, class, ER, block, and kanban renderers
- Parser fix: edge labels with quoted text (`-->|"Yes"|`) no longer rendered as spaces

## 0.3.0 (2026-03-25)

### Rendering engine overhaul

- **Directional canvas**: junction characters derived from direction bitfields instead of a lookup table, producing correct junctions in all cases
- **Gap expansion**: crossing edges between layers automatically get extra routing space so they no longer overlap
- **Endpoint spreading**: overlapping arrows on the same node border are spread apart so all edges are visible
- **Subgraph separation**: nodes stay inside their declared subgraph even with cross-boundary edges
- **Routing bias**: edges prefer the natural flow direction, avoiding tight corners next to node borders
- **Label separation**: edge labels from different edges no longer merge onto the same output line
- **Parser fix**: arrow syntax inside quoted labels (`A["has --> arrow"]`) no longer confuses the parser

### New diagram type

- **Mindmaps** (`mindmap` syntax): indentation-based tree layout with automatic overflow to the left for crowded roots, rounded/sharp/ASCII branch characters

### CLI improvements

- `--width N`: set max output width, re-renders with smaller gap/padding if exceeded
- `-o FILE` / `--output FILE`: write output to file instead of stdout
- `--show-ids`: show node IDs alongside labels for debugging
- `--no-auto-fit`: disable automatic terminal width compaction
- `NO_COLOR` environment variable respected
- `--version` reads from package metadata instead of hardcoded string
- Auto-fit: diagrams that exceed terminal width are automatically re-rendered with compact settings

### Code quality

- Layout engine split from 1 file (1095 lines) into 5 focused modules
- 1066 tests, 0 failures, 0 xfails (up from 1004 tests, 5 xfails)
